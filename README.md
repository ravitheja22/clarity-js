# Clarity

## About the project
Clarity is a client-side JavaScript library that helps you understand how users view and use your webpage across all devices and browsers. 
Understanding how the users navigates, interacts and browses your website can provide new insights about your users.  Empathizing with your users and see where features fail or succeed can help improve your product/site, grow revenue and user retention.

Clarity provides you all these insights by:
* Observing content layout, view port, and user's interactions with the page
* Inspecting network requests on the page
* Logging the information by sending JSON objects to a specified endpoint

Clarity is a project in active development. While it's not yet ready for production use, we continue making improvements and encourage the community to join us in the process!

## Project Goals
* Enable a generic solution that is able to capture telemetry from third-party web-sites
* Encourage participation from open-source community
* Minimal configuration required by third party web-sites to get started
* Mobile first

## Privacy Notice
Clarity handles sensitive data with care. By default content on the page is masked before upload, so no actual text from the page is sent to the server.
All data collection is performed solely with the purpose of providing better insights into customers' pages interactions and improving their users' experiences.
